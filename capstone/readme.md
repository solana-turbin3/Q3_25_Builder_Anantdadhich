# Capstone Project

Check out my capstone project here (still lots of work needed, currently built locally and deploy on devnet ) :
[NeuralTrader](https://github.com/Anantdadhich/NeuralTrader)

Programs for capstone: anchor-programs

Capstone Devnet Deploy Program Id: GAmxv5ze5Y1rvaJziz8nrnFtz4pBuF14YDvs8iqm7XkB

Signature: jDc26V5XeCaQjxaAcv1jV4qcLYgfaYkh1BH85QwbXLvsNR1GAuijR1gGDKdMGXaqVQ3hRGLtVxttGo1haJrX2rj

Still a lot of work remains; it is not yet fully correct or fully built want to add oracle price and connect frontend with anchor .

## NeuralTrader
A sophisticated simulation of an autonomous AI-powered trading ecosystem where hundreds of LLM-powered AI agents interact,communicate with each other and marketplace to trade a tokens in the Solana environment.

## Overview
NeuralTrader creates a self-sustaining virtual economy where AI agents with unique personalities, trading strategies, and communication styles trade tokens using realistic market dynamics, without requiring human intervention.

This simulation demonstrates how AI agents can form emergent behaviors in financial markets, showcasing group dynamics, price discovery mechanisms, and social influence in trading.

Live Demo which is built locally still not devnet added

## Problem ?
Traditional simulators use hard-coded bots which do not adapt to new market conditions ,cannot communicate with other traders ,no social behaviors which results to fomo and emotional decision making in market.
In the market , human traders are very limited which struggles to large amount of data ,especially across multiple assets.
Current AMM lacks social layers they just focus on how pool works but they fail to capture how news spread accross a market or sentiment shifts


## Solution Why NeuralTrader

It not just a bot based market simulator It's ecosystem where large number of ai agents built with LangChain which will trade a tokens on decentralized exchange built on on-chain AMM simulation.
Market decision will based on market signals ,agent communication.
Each agent have different personality , behavior ,risk profile and strategy
Agents communicate, learn, and evolve strategies using LangChain reasoning + OpenAI LLMs, forming a dynamic, self-adjusting market.
All actions happen on-chain using the Solana Agent Kit: simulated liquidity pool behavior , fast transactions ,market-sentiment-informed decision making
NeuralTrader is more than just a simulation â€” it's a sandbox for the future of DeFi. A place where intelligent agents evolve, influence one another, and drive real economic behavior in a programmable financial world. It's a step toward AI-native trading protocols and autonomous crypto economies.
